Pointer:
A pointer is like having your friend’s home address written on paper. You don’t have the friend, you only know where they live.

Reference:
A reference is like giving your friend a nickname. Same person, just another name.

Pointers 


1) Pointers is nothing but it just stores the address of an variable . 

example :
int y = 10 ; 
int *x = &y ; 

Now here x is an pointer which stores the address of y . 
Ok , what is the use of storing an var address ? 
I want to access the variable , how can i do it ? 

*x = &y 
what is &y ?

Great ! 
y stores value 10 
now pointer x stores the address of y ie 10 .
if i want to access this variable I need *x
easy go :


    int x = 10 ;
    int *y = &x ;
    
    std::cout << x << std::endl ;    10
    std::cout << &x << std::endl ;   0x7ffda25ea74c
    std::cout << y << std::endl ;    0x7ffda25ea74c
    std::cout << &y << std::endl ;   0x7ffda25ea750
    std::cout << *y << std::endl ;   10
